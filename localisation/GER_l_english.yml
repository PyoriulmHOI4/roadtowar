 ### Events
 GER.1.t:0 "Appointing a Minister"
 GER.1.d:0 "As the Great Depression ravages not just the German nation but literally the whole globe, everyone is finally starting to address the real threat that it brings. Our nation must not slack behind the others.\nCurrently, we have two options as to an economic minister to appoint to help us mitigate the damage of the Great Depression. On one end, we have former president of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht. Schacht wants to be able to pursue a more militaristic and self-sufficient economic doctrine, autarky, and his loyalty to the Nazi Party is a great reason as to why we should appoint him as our minister. On the other end is Walther Funk. Funk possesses the ideals of the technocratic doctrine, advocating for spending more on the sciences and technology to progress. However, his lack of loyalty to the NSDAP makes him a worrying choice.\nNow, we must make a choice as to who is the right option to move the state forward. Who must we pick?"
 GER.1.a:0 "Hjalmar Schacht"
 GER.1.b:0 "Walther Funk"
 GER.2.t:0 "The Great Depression Ends In Germany"
 GER.2.d:0 "Today, Herr Hitler approaches Berlin with a speech. The morning is cold and the Führer shivers in his trenchcoat. The nation was confused and curious as to what the savior of Germany had to say to his people.\n\n"The administration has realized that the Great Depression and its effects have come to a halt. Businesses are slowly reopening, banks open up again, and German society is beginning to come back to what it was before the crash on Wall Street." The depression that Herr Hitler is talking of was abysmal and destroyed the economy of all nations and the crowd comes to silence. Hitler continues to speak to the crowd. "Due to the slow and steady return to normal, I am ecstatic to announce that we are declaring the end to the Great Depression in Germany!" The crowd springs up and shouts with excitement. "I will begin allowing regular business still under close to open up but under guidelines of the Reich but for now, the Depression is over!"\n\nThe Great Depression has now halted its effects and the economy springs to normal. No one knows if this return will last forever."
 GER.2.a:0 "We have emerged victorious."

 GER_Recover_From_The_Depression:0 "Recover From The Depression"
 GER_Recover_From_The_Depression_desc:0 "In 1929, the stock market in America crashed. Soon after, across the world, the Great Depression ensued. Every country was bound to its knees with economic downturn, political instability, and a horrid time of their nation and Germany, then the Weimar Republic, was no exception. This accelerated the already quick rise of extreme groups including ours, the Nazi Party. Despite the fact that we are only in charge because of that crash, there's no doubt that the economic stains have only negatively impacted the country. It's time that now, we start to reverse it."
 GER_The_Two_Sides:0 "The Two Sides"
 GER_The_Two_Sides_desc:0 "With our economic recovery plans well underway, we need to start to recognize the two methods and factions of different understandings of how to fix our broken economy. The technocratic faction wants to appoint leaders based on their knowledge in technology and the sciences and wants to move forward scientifically. The autarkic faction wants to appoint leaders that will help the nation self-sustain the economy and aims to mobilize the German economy without the assistance of other nations or foreign advisors. Who do we choose?"
